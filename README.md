# 🤖 Smart Data Preprocessing Pipeline for Machine Learning Projects

This project provides a complete and reusable **data preprocessing pipeline** for machine learning and data science tasks. It covers key steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and preparing data for training models.

---

## 📌 Features

- Load and inspect raw data
- Handle missing/null values
- Encode categorical variables (Label & One-Hot Encoding)
- Scale numerical features using StandardScaler
- Split data into training and test sets
- Ready-to-use template for any ML project
